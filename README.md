# mlpredictor

Notice: this is a work in progress

This is a software component that can be used in conjunction with 
other software components. 

It has two parts: a ml classifier and a predictor. 

The classifier will use any classification algorithm 
(such as Naive Bayes) and will generate a model based on some data.

The model and raw data fed to this predictor will be used to 
make basic predictions.
